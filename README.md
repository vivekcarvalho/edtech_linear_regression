## Graduate Admissions Analysis Using Linear Regression
Objective: To help an Education Consultant understand the key factors contributing to graduate admissions and their correlations, and to create a predictive model for forecasting a candidate’s chances of admission.

Key Factors:
1.	GRE Score: Standardized test score for graduate admissions.
2.	TOEFL Score: English proficiency test score.
3.	University Ranking: Rating of the university.
4.	Research Contribution: Involvement in research activities.
5.	CGPA: Cumulative Grade Point Average.
6.	Letter of Recommendation (LOR): Strength of recommendations.
7.	Statement of Purpose (SOP): Quality of the applicant’s statement.
   
Predictive Model:
•	Model Used: Linear regression with polynomial degree 3.
•	Performance: Achieved 96% accuracy on the test dataset and 92% on the validation dataset.

Insights and Recommendations:
1.	GRE and TOEFL Scores: Higher scores positively impact admission chances.
2.	University Ranking: Higher-ranked universities increase the likelihood of admission.
3.	Research Contribution: Significant research experience boosts the profile.
4.	CGPA: A higher CGPA is a strong predictor of admission success.
5.	LOR and SOP: Strong letters of recommendation and a compelling statement of purpose are crucial.
Conclusion: The polynomial regression model effectively predicts admission chances, providing valuable insights for education consultants to guide candidates in enhancing their profiles for better admission prospects.
